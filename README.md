# Portfolio Website Wireframe 

This wireframe project is based on **my personal portfolio website**. Designing my own portfolio was challenging, but it helped me understand the wireframing process in a deeper and more practical way.I started by breaking the layout into reusable components. After creating these components, I consistently reused them across the entire wireframe, which helped maintain structure, consistency, and clarity in the design.

Through this task, I learned the importance of planning before design, component-based thinking, and organizing layouts properly. This project also improved my understanding of UI structure, spacing, and user flow. Overall, it was a valuable learning experience that strengthened both my UI/UX design approach and my confidence in creating structured wireframes.
This project helped me improve my ability to think from a user’s perspective while designing layouts. I focused on keeping the wireframe simple, clear, and easy to understand without unnecessary visual elements.

This project includes two separate wireframe frames: one designed for desktop screens and another for mobile devices (Android medium frame). The desktop frame focuses on a structured layout with clear section hierarchy, while the mobile frame is optimized for smaller screens and touch-friendly navigation.Both wireframes were created to maintain design consistency while adapting the layout according to different screen sizes. This approach helped me understand responsive design planning and how user experience changes across devices. Including both frames ensures better clarity for future development and implementation.

I followed basic UI/UX principles such as alignment, hierarchy, and consistency to ensure a well-structured design. The wireframe was created with the intention of being easily converted into a responsive website in the future.Working on this task also enhanced my problem-solving skills, as I learned how to handle layout challenges and improve design flow. Overall, this task was a great opportunity to apply my learning in a practical and real-world scenario.

Wireframe preview images for both desktop and mobile frames are also included to showcase the responsive layout structure.
